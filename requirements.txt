- Count from 1 to 50
- Output it to the screen
- If a number is evenly divisible by 3,
  output "Fizz" instead of the number
- If a number is evenly divisible by 5,
  output "Buzz" instead of the number.

BUT if a number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5
output "FizzBuzz"

AND I need you to count between 75 and 125
