- Count from 75 to 125
- Output it to the screen
- If a number is evenly divisible by 3,
  output "Fizz" instead of the number
- If a number is evenly divisible by 5,
  output "Buzz" instead of the number.
- If a number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5
  output "FizzBuzz"

BUT if a number is evenly divisible by 7,
output "Woof", and if it's evenly divisible
by 3, 5 and 7, output FizzBuzzWoof, 3 and 7
should be "FizzWoof", 5 and 7 should be
"BuzzWoof".
